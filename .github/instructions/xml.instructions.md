# XML Instructions for Apik CVDL Odoo Projects
---

## XML Coding Standards

- Use XML 1.0 or 1.1 specifications
- Keep the XML structure simple and avoid unnecessary nesting
- Include comments only to explain complex XML structures

## Odoo Specific Guidelines

- Follow Odoo's XML coding guidelines and best practices.
- Use Odoo's built-in XML templates and views whenever possible.
- Leverage Odoo's QWeb templating engine for dynamic content rendering.
- Use the `t-` attributes for Odoo-specific directives (e.g., `t-field`, `t-foreach`, `t-if`).
- From Odoo 18 onwards, use `list` instead of `tree` for list views.
