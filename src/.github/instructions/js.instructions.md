# JavaScript Instructions for Apik CVDL Odoo Projects
---


## Coding standards
- Use JavaScript with ES2022 features
- Ask the user if you require any additional dependencies before adding them
- Always use async/await for asynchronous code
- Keep the code simple and maintainable
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Do not add comments unless absolutely necessary or critical, the code should be self-explanatory
- Never use `null`, always use `undefined` for optional values
- Prefer functions over classes

## User interactions
- Ask questions if you are unsure about the implementation details, design choices, or need clarification on the requirements
- Always answer in the same language as the question, but use english for the generated content like code, comments or docs
